γ PARAGUAY. 161

Mamalukes, such as Loretto, St. Ignatius‚ διο.
were removed to safer places, by a journey of
many monthS, and with incredible labour, both
of the Fathers and of the Indians. Nor did the
Mamalukes spare our colonies of the Chiquitos
and Moxos, nor others in the lands of the Spa-
niards, which were administered both by the
secular and regular clergy. The Indian towns
settled on the banks of the Yeyuy‘, in Curuquati,
and many others, were entirely destroyed by
the Mamalukes. The same fate attended Xe-
rez, Guayra, (Ciudad reah) Villarica, &c. cities
of the Spaniards. Who can describe all the
devastation committed in Paraguay? Hear
what is said on this subject in the collection of
Lettres Curiezcses et Eclifia22tes.·-—“ Itis asserted,''
say they, “ that in the space os one hundred and
thirty years, two millions of lndians were slain,
or carried into captivity by the Mamalukes of
Brazi13 and that more than one thousand leagues
of country, as far as the river Amazon, was
stripped of inhabitants. It appears from au-
thentic letters, (sent by the Catholic King ffl—
in the year 1639, lssth Sept.) that in five years
three hundred thousand Paraguayrian Indians
were carried away into Brazil.” Pedro de Avila,
Governour of Buenos-Ayres, declared that In-
dians were openly sold, in his sight, by the
inhabitants of the town of St. Paulo, at Rio
