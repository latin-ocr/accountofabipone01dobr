PARAGUAY: 361

terate it to increase the weight. There are
three trees in Paraguay, all materially different,
but much alike in name3 I mean the cupay, the
curupafs, and the czcrztpicay. The curupay
affords bark like that of the cevil, which the
Indians use to dress ox-hides with. To give
them a red colour they mix the bark of the
curupay with that of another trec, (the caatigua,
which the Abipones call achite.) The curu-
picay, a tree not larger nor harder than the
elder, has a spungy kind of wood, unfit for
any purpose, that I know of, which at the

slightest touch, sheds a milky juice commonly
thought to be poisonous.

PINoN DEL PARAGUAY, on
THE CATHARTIC NUT.

This is a shrub resembling the fig tree of
our country, in its leaves, its form, and the sost-
ness of its wood. The trunk and leaves, when
pressed with the hand distil a milky juice
abounding in serum. It bears fruit like dark
walnuts, beneath the hard black rind of which
lie three white kernels, covered with a white
membrane and divided into as many separate
compartments3 in sweetness, and in shape they
resemble almonds. These kerneIS, ρι’ῆοηεε del
Paragzcczy, or piny nuts of Paraguay, are called.
