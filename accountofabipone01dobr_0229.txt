PARAGUAY. 211

,Governour of Paraguay, and I cannot tell whe-
ther it- excited his laughter or his indignation
the most. I would have bought the smallest
particle of a diamond at any price, to cut the
glass for the various uses of the church, but
could never meet with any one who possessed
such a thing, and waS, consequently, always
obliged to make use of a flint instead. If the
savages at the straits of Magellan have any
metal‚ they must have got itfrom the mountains
where every one knows that metals are found.
But the province of Chili differs as much from
Paraguay, as Austria does from its neighbour
Hungary. The one abounds in gold and sssver,
the other is absolutely destitute of both. The
Portu‘gueze in Cuyaba, in Matto Grosso, and in
the fortlet of Sta. Rosa, collect sands from
various rivers, out of which they pick very
small particles of gold, formerly with the con-
nivance of the SpaniardS, and since the last
,declaration of peace with their open consent.
For the Portugueze always contended that the
above—mentioned territories were comprehended
within the limits of Brazil, whilst the Spaniards
annexed them to Paraguay, or their own Peru.
Τ hat you may perceive the truth of what I say,
Iwill fairly describe the liberality of nature
towards Paraguay. You shall see and laugh at
its· treasures. .
