mon reed no otherwise than in having more
joints‚ and a smaller space between each. Itis
adorned with beautifully green and very large
leaveS, especially at ,the top. It is about four
inches thick. Though the plant is seven or*
eight feet high, great part of it towards the top
is thrown away, being devoid of juice, and very
full of leaves. Sugar canes like a rich and moist
soil, nor will they grow much on 111115, though
well watered. More earth must be heaped on
¹the sugar cane after it has been lately planted
¹in the summer, less in the winter, that it may
not bud too much3 for the more leaves it bears
the less juice it will yield. WeedS, which suck
up the moisture of the earth, must be carefully
extirpated. Moderate frosts are useful to the
full gr'own caneS, because they thicken the
sweet liquor; immoderate ones do harm, be-
cause they exhaust it all. Ants, which are de-
structive to the young caneS‚ must be carefully
kept away. Many other arts, proper to be used
in the rearing and expression of caneS‚ and the
converting of them into sugar, I choose to omit
for the sake of brevity. I have briefly de-
scribed the principal ones, that Europeans may
be made thoroughly acquainted with the origin
of sugar, which they know so well how to con-
sume, and cease to wonder that these reedy
