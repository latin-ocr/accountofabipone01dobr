PARAGUAY. 107

care, never grow so high as those of nature's own
Setting in the sorests. Those however which
are planted and cultivated by us, in three or
four years time produce a plenteous crop of
leaves, so that the labour attending artificial
woods is sufficiently repaid by the aster-profit.
Woods are likewise sown by various birds,
which swallow with great avidity the seeds of
the herb-tree; these being, by reason of their
natural gluten, indigestible, pass through them,
and falling into moist ground, become the daily
origin of new treeS‚ and gradually of forests.

I have often been asked, why the herb of
Paraguay is never exported to Europe, and Ι
have answered, on many accounts In the first
place, very little more is prepared than suffices
the AmericanS. If, moreover, the Spaniards of
Paraguay gasped after commerce and gain,
they might export not only this herb, but many
other profitable commodities. Their ships,
especially in time os war, are few3 their secu-
rity none. 'Add to this, that in a few years it
spoils, and losing its original fragrance smells
like Russian shoe-leather3 when in this state,
it is used by the Paraguayrians to die cloth
black. The Europeans, moreover, having never
so much as tasted the herb, have no desire to
fetch it froin America, which they would cer-
tainly do, if acquainted with its virtues. Oh!
