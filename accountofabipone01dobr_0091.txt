enough supplied from their own land. Every
year new clothes are distributed to each.
Knives, axes, glass-beads‚ and similar orna-

cians are night and day in attendance on the
sick, who carefully provide them with food pre-
pared in the father's dwelling, and with fit
medicine, as occasion requires, If any of you
think I have made a greater boast of these
things than truth warrantS, see before you stand
Indian Christians, your brothers, and my com-
panions and clients, of whom the greater part
were born and brought up in woods like your-
selves, and now, sor many years back, have
lived under my authority in St. J oachim. Cast
your eyes on their garments. Enquire from
them the mode of life which exists amongst us.
You will quickly learn that they are contented
with their lot, and think themselves most happy
in every point of view. They have been what
you are now; and you have it in your power
to be what they now are. Do not deny your-
selves this felicity. Consider whether it be ex-
pedient to immure yourselves in dusky woods,
the prey of successive calamitieS, and final
death. It rests with you to act conformably
to my good instructions. With open arms we
will receive you as friends receive friends, and
without delay make you our fellow townsmen.
