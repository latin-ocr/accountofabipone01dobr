PARAGUAY. 151

Buenos-Ayres, his business left unfinished‚ but
himself, for his signal fortitude, his magnani-
mity‚ and apostolic ardour, truly deserving of
honour and imitation.

In the year 1765, a large merchant-ship
’ freighted to the value of some millionS, destined
to Callao, a harbour of Linia, was stranded and
lost off the island of Terra del Fuego. The
crew fortunately escaped, and reached the
island in a boat, the ship gradually foundering.
Part of the provision, the cannon, and other ne-
cessaries for supporting life, were providently
got out of the leaking vessel. A hill, neigh-
bouring to the sea, was occupied by the ship-
wrecked SpaniardS, and fortified by I don't
know how many cannon. These being dis-
charged, a troop of the Indian inhabitants was
seen advancing from afar. They were entirely
naked, and each kept rubbing his belly with his
hands. On a second explosion‚ they all fell on
the ground, still continuing, however, to rub
their bellies. This ridiculous action of *the
savages the Spaniards were in doubt whether to
construe into a sign of friendship, or of hostility.
As no one understood their language, they were
invited by gentle tones, friendly nods, and little
gists displayed to them, till at length they ap-
proached the station of the SpaniardS, still

rubbing their belli‘es without interniission.
