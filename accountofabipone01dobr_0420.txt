lows, used both medicinally and for other pur-

THE ΑΜΒΑῨ.

The ambay, a kind of wild fig, grows pretty
high in the course of a few months. The body
of the tree is slender, and perforated like an
elder3 the bark such as is peculiar to figs; and
the wood white like thatsof a birch, but so soft
that it may be cut with a knife. It has few
boughS‚ but is adorned with very large leaves,
for the lively verdure of which it is greatly com-
mended, as well as for the salubrity of its bark,
juice, and leaf, which, applied in various wayS,
stop running of the reins, too copious dis-
charges, and looseness of the bowels.

THE WALNUT.

Walnuts, no ways differing from those of our
own country, are very common in the woods of
Tucuman‚ but scarce seen in other parts of
Paraguay. Their wood is employed in making
pistol-cases, handleS, and for other kinds of ca-
binet-maker's work. The nuts are of different
sorts, for some are very large, with a sost rind,
others quite dwarfish, and with rinds as hard
as a stone.
