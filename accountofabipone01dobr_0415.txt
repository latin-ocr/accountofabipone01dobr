PARAGUAY. 397

ground that had formerly been wooded, to yield
a more abundant harvest than what was sown
in a marshy situation. For a place that has
been previously occupied by trees, retainS, for
a long time, its native humidity, and the ashes
of the trees that have been cut down and burnt
on the spot, incredibly fertilize the soil. In
places of this kind the Guaranies used to sow
tobacco, maize‚ and most other things except
cotton, with great success. But, good hea-
vens! how have I lost myself in this labyrinth
of trees, shrubS, and plants! I shall hardly be
able to find my way out of the wood3 yet it is
best to tarry there awhile till, after having de-
scribed the medicinal trees, I have enumerated
all the rest which are useful in building, or on
other accounts worthy of note.

THE ΤΑΥῨ, on URUNDEY
QUEBRACHO.

The tayy, or tajibo‚ and the urundey que-
bracho, either of a red, or pale colour, excel in
hardness and size ; both trees are called by the
Spaniards quebracho, or quebralmclzo, because,
unless dexterously cut by a skilful woodman,
or carpenter‚ they break the axe at the first
blow, being as hard as iron; sor lzaclzcz means
an axe, and quebrar to break. Thc quebracho
colorado, when covered with its bark, is red.
