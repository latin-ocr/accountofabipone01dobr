tail full of scurf, and their hair matted together,
the perspiration is obstructed by the pores be-

On this account, the Spaniards and AbiponeS,
who are most careful of their property, though
less solicitous than Europeans about combing‚
washing, and rubbing down their horses, and
unprovided with instruments for those pur-
p'oses, take great care to prevent their growing

dirty, though they have no other stable than '

the open plain, day and night, during every
part of the year. If thistles, thornS, and other
prickly plants of that kind stick to their tails,
they carefully extricate them by anointing their
hair with tallow. After performing a journey,
when the harness is taken off, they wash and
wipe the back of the horse, which is bathed in
perspiration, and lest the coldness of the air
should cause it to swell, keep it covered, for
some time, with a horsecloth. Moreover the
health and liveliness of horses are best preserved
by taking care that their pastures be not situ-
ated very far either from clear lakes or limpid
rivers, where the horses may drink and bathe
at their pleasure; for in the winter months
the cold air makes thern lean and mangy, and
the ‚frequent droughts produce the same effect
