cut off from the trees with a bill, are parched for
some time on beams laid cross-wise over the fire3
after which the leaves, with the smaller twigs,
are spread on the ground, and beat to powder
with sticks. When prepared by this less labo-
rious method, itis called yerba cle palos, because
it is composed of leaves and leaf-stemS, and
their fibres, which are in a certain degree woody.
An arroba (which is twenty-five pounds) of this
herb, is sold in the forest for nearly two German
florins; in the city of Asumpcion‚ from the
expense of carriage, the price is double. The
caci-miri is sold at a double price, being pre-
pared by our GuaranieS, with more labour and
accuracy; for they carefully separate and throw
aside the leaf-stems and larger fibres. After
parching the leaves at a slow fire, they pound
them gently in a wooden mortar, taking care
not to beat them too small. For the more en-
tire they remam, the more taste and smell they
possess3 if pulverized very small, they lose
both. Caci-miri signifies the small herb, being
made by the Indian Guaranies of the tendet
parts of the leaves, the leaf-stems and all the
particles of wood being excluded3 it is not,
however, reduced to powder, like that of the
Spaniards The herb, when properly prepared,
