PARAGUAY. 421

matter of little difficulty to the AbiponeS‚ who,
when the sky is clear, and the sun bright,
ride out on horseback into the country. Be-
ing possessed of wonderfully quick eyesight,
they perceive the bees flying about, and leaving
their horse at the bank of a river, pursue thern
on foot till they see what tree they enter ε this
they climb with all the agility of apes, open a
hole by way osa door, and as a mark of the hive,
take out the honey and wax into a leathern bag,
and carry it home, where their friends, wives,
and children soon consume these adventitious
sweets, either by eating them like ambrosia, or
drinking them like nectar. But if a general
drinking-party be appointed on any occasion,
the honey they bring is mixed with cold water,
and stirred for a little while with a stick3 when,
without addition of any other ferment, it effer-
vesces, froths, and becomes wine in the space
of some hours, and taken even in small quanti-
ties intoxicates the Indians like very pure wine:
for we have found two or three cups sufficient
to upset their naturally imbecile minds. Wax
is scarce ever used amongst the Indians : for the
fire, which is always kept alive on the floor of
the hut, serves to dress the food by day, and
supplies the place of a candle by night.
