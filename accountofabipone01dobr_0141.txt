διο. ; who shall number them all, when they are
almost innumerable, and often unnamed ? Most
of these, after a long drought, become almost
dry, a no uncommon occurrence in Chaco. You
may often travel many leagues where not even
a bird could discover a drop of water. On the
other hand, when the sky is prodigal of its
hoard, the brooks seem rivers, and the rivers
seaS‚ whole plains being inundated. During
many journies of many weeks, when we had to
contend with water, mud, and deep marshes,
there was often not a palm of dry land where
we could rest at night. The Spanish soldiers
who were with me sometimes ascended high
trees, and perching there, like* birds, enjoyed
some portion os rest during the night. Several
of them lighted a fire there to heat their water.
But the calamity was sar more intolerable when
we had to ride, without resting day or night,
for many leagueS, under a burning sun, before
we reached a situation where we could obtain
water for ourselves and our horseS. At other
places, you might traverse immense plains
without seeing a twig to light a fire with.
