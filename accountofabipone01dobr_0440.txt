SALT.

From honey let us proceed to salt, which is
in great request both amongst the savages and
almost all beasts, though they are scarce ever
able to procure it: for notwithstanding that
some parts of Paraguay abound in salt either
natural, or artificial, yet none of either kind can
be obtained throughout immense tracts of land,
unless it be brought at a great expense from
other places. All the Guarany towns are
destitute of chalk, and salt, both of which are
forced to be conveyed in ships, or waggons,
from the remote colonies of the Spaniards, are
often purchased at an exorbitant price, often
not to be procured. In the xCordoban territo-
rieS, and elsewhere, the lakes which have been
exhausted by a long drought do indeed afford
coagulated salt3 but during time of drought it
is very difficult to reach those lakes, as the
plains, through which you must pass, deny
water both to the carrierS, and to the oxen, by
whom the salt is conveyed in waggons to the
cities. In rainy seasons, when those lakes are
full, no salt is coagulated, which being frequently
the case, salt is in consequence often scarce
and dear. In many places under the jurisdic-
tion of the cities Asumpcion, and St. Iago,
nitre collected in the plai'nS, or salt water boiled
