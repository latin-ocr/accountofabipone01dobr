tigers which they slew, fastened with stakes to
the folds of the cattle, as testimonies of their vi-
gilance and courage, in the same manner as the
heads and hands of criminals are seen fixed to a
pole in the place appointed for their punishment.
In a certain estate I got up upon the hedges, exa-
mined the heads of the lions and tigers,of which
there was an immense number, observed their
eyes, earS, and teeth‚ and tore some hair out of
the whiskers of the tigers, which resembled wire,
were thick at the root, and endued with a kind
of elastic property. Ι cannot understand Why
the Abipones do not rear the whelps of lionsss as
they reckon tigers' whelps a dainty, though they
are never procured without danger. Before
they are full grown they give proofs of their na-
tive ferocity, and With their little tender claws
and teeth fly upon all they meet, especially in
the heat of the sun. One man deprived a tiger's
whelp of its teeth and claws, to prevent it from
doing any mischief‚ but though destitute of its
arms, it used to rush upon children and calves,
and would certainly have crushed and strangled
them, had they not been instantly rescued.
That the danger might not increase as he grew
up, he was forced to be shot.
