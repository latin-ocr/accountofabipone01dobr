Reductions‚ and from them, in a very short

nish agriculturists would but imitate this piece
of industry‚ how much would their fortunes be
benefited! But the planting of woods of this
kind requires art, and patience, and the labour
of many hands. The seed of the 6αὰ being ex-

till that native gluten be thoroughly removed3
which if you neglect, your time will be lost, and
your hopes frustrated. The ground in which
you mean to sow the prepared seed must be
copiously d'renched with water, and almost ren-

A ditch, two feet deep and as many broad,
must be dug, to receive and retain the rainwater3
and in the middle of each ditch the plants are to
