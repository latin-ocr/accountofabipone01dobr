PARAGUAY. 305

It feeds upon honey, little birds' eggs, orangeS,
sweet citrons, and other fruits. It is incredibly
tenacious of life, for after being stripped of its
skin, and having received frequent wounds on
the head, it will not die, till its head be severed
from its body. Though the horrible form of the
yguana inspires all beholders with terror, yet its
extremely white flesh delights the palates of
many. Deceived by my companion, I ate it sor
fish, and at another time for chicken‚ and pro-
nounced it exceedingly savoury. But Ι never
could prevail upon myself knowingly to taste
the yguana, so great was the horror which I
conceived of its external appearance. The
yguana lays about forty eggs in as many days;
they are round, about the size of a walnut‚ and
of a white or yellowish hue, like hens' eggS.
Some people eat them fried. As they abeund
in their own native sat, water is poured on them
instead of oil or butter. They say that little
stones are sometimes found in the head of the
yguana, which, when ground to powder, and
drunk with a wholesome potion, ,or simply ap-
plied to the body, diminish or remove stone in
the kidneys. Others affirm that a stone, an
’ ounce in weight‚ is found in some other part of
this animal's body, which, when reduced to
powder‚ and drunk in tepid water, removes ob-
structions of the bladder. 1 never saw any
