304 AccooNT or THE A-BIPONEse

out to hunt otters. If the water is shallow‘
enough to ford, hounds are sent sorwards, and
many hundreds killed with stakes in one day,
though they are extremely apt to bite, and have
very sharp teeth, on which account, in killing
them, both the Indians and their dogs often re-
ceive wounds which are not cured in a few days‘

THE YGUANA.

The yguana, an animal of the lizard kind,
closely resembles the dragon which St. George
is represented overthrowing. It is some*
times more than an ell long. Its belly is large,
its skin clothed with green, white, and yellow
scales, elegantly varied with red. From the
head to the extremity of the tail, the spine of the
back is surmounted by a denticulated fin. Its
thick and very long tail is marked with kinds of
black rings, intermixed with red ones, and ends
in a very slender point. It is furnished with large*
black eyes, a nose spreading as wide as the lips,
short teeth, a cloven tongue‚ which, when irri-
tated, it moves very quickly, four feet, and lower
down five nails, wide like the sole of th'e foot,
and covered with a thin web, which assists it in
swimming· 3 sor it sometimes swims in the water, ’
sometimes climbs trees, and sometimes lurks for·
a long time in corners of houses, being very pa-
tient of hunger. It never does harm to any one.
