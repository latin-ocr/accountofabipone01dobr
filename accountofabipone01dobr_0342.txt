The paracaubay‘ is of the same size and form
as the paracautee3 but its feathers are almost
all green, with but a very sparing admixture o'f
blue ones, and perhaps a little yellow‚ or red
feather here and there on its head, wings, and
tail. These birds babble some unintelligible
stuff, but never utter an articulate sound.

The aruay, which is somewhat smaller than
the former, is of a most lovely shape, adorned
with red, yellow, and bright green feathers‚
and capable of talking a great deal, if instructed.

The iribaya, which scarce exceeds a Euro-
pean linnet in size, is sparingly besprent with
a few dark green, red, and blue featherS, and is
distinguished from the rest by a white circle
round the eyes. Though of a very lively tem-
per, garrulous‚ restless, and apt to bite, it is
unable to learn to talk, and has a harsh voice. ,
Some woods abound to such a degree in these
birds, that no other kind of parrot can be seen
there.

The mbaracana, and others of the same kind
that are entirely green, being devoid of all
beauty and docility, are seldom taught by the

cies. The greenness of their plumage is praised
