340 AccouNT or THE ABIPONES.

weighs half a pound, while in the larger ones it
grows to the size of two or more pounds3 but
its length never corresponds to its breadth. It
has a curved back, thick head, wide mouth,
small round eyes, and a broad forked tail. Be-
sides the formidable Jaw which I have described,
it threatens all assailants with large, long gills‚
and seven sharp finS‚ the largest of which is si-
tuated in the middle of the back, and runs to-
wards the tail. The body is covered with faint
grey spots, interspersed with red, blue, and
yellow. The flesh is firm, white, and very sa-
voury3 I wish that it were not so full of bones.
When the hook is extracted, these fish must be
handled with caution, otherwise they will wound
you with their teeth or finS.

fed upon serpents. Whether these fishes are
really eels, or of the serpent kind, I will not pre-
