PARAGUAY. 179

certain that the Spaniards their snccessors
have sailed on the river Paraguay sixty leagues
beyond that lake, which proves that we must
seek for the source of it in the more distant
mountains situated towards the north-east.
Some have thought that it proceeds from the
fabulous lake Del Dorado. Bourgainville asserts
that the Paraguay takes its rise between the fif-
teenth and sixteenth degrees of north latitude,
at almost an equal distance from the North and
South Seas. This opinion of the Frenchman I
willingly leave to be examined by the later Por-
tugueze who have dwelt there. However this
may be, it has been clearly ascertained that the
Paraguay does not take its rise from the lake
Xarayes‚ as such a lake exists no where but in
geographical charts3 for that collection of
waters which is sometimes seen is not the pa-
rent of the river Paraguay, but the offspring of
it. This I boldly affirm on the authority of
Father J oseph Sanchez Labrador, a curious na-
turalist‚ who repeatedly traversed both banks
of the Paraguay, aud by them arrived at the
towns of the Chiquitos. The Chiquito town
dedicated to St. Xavier is situated more to-
wards the north than the rest, lying, as the
same Sanchez observed, in the loth degree of
latitude‚ and the 3l3th degree of longitude.
