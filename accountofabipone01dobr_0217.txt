PARAGUAY. 199

Theatre of the Indies‚'’ vol. ii. affirms that the
river La Plata enters the sea by mouths eighty
leagues in width. I leave you to form your
own opinion on the subject.

I have crossed this channel twice, but must
own I never measured it. It is certain, that
incautious or too credulous captains are often
deceived by the wideness of this vast river,
which prevents them from seeing both shores
of it. Trusting too much to their own fallacious
calculations, they think themselves sailing on
the ocean, and boldly proceed with spread sails,
and without consulting the sounding-line, but
at length when the ship strikes upon shoals,
perceive too late that they are in the river
Plata, and frequently perish. I write this on
my own experience. On St. Thomas's day the
ship proceeded full sail, and with a wind as
favourable as could be desired. WVe observed
little birds, never at other times seen on the
ocean, flying about, bits of grass floating, and
the colour of the water changed, from all which
it was easy to conclude that we were near land.
We represented these circumstances over and
over again to the captain, a Portugueze, who,
though in other respects a worthy and prudent
man, relied too much on his own observations,
and was somewhat pertinacious and opiniated.
He insisted upon it that we were sar from land,
