from reeds that they may dry a little, and re-
main some hours under the shade of a roof.
The stem Which runs through the ‘middle of the‘
leaf is either beaten down with a bat or removed
entirely. The leaves thus prepared are twisted
into ropes, by means of a Wheel, and then rolled
upon a cylindrical piece of wood. This cylin-
der, With its tobacco, is placed under the shade
of a roof in such a manner that it may receive
the heat of the sun, and yet not be touched by
any of its rays. The tobacco, thus compressed
spirally upon the cylinder, exudes a black, glu—
tinous juice, Which falls drop by drop into a hide
placed underneath. This juice flows daily
through, and in like manner is daily poured ,
again upon the folds ; and When the whole mass
is thoroughly penetrated by the liquor, it will
be necessary to roll the spira] folds daily back
again from one cylinder to another. By this
method, the lowest part of the tobacco nearest
the first cylinder is transferred on the next to the
surface, imbibes the juice equally, blackenS, and
grows rich like lard. To effect this, the trans-
