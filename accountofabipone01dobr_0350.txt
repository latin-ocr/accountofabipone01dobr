STORKS.

Paraguay is not destitute of river-fowl‚ very
like European herons and storks.

THE HARIA.

The haria, which is about the size of a stork,
boldly attacks serpents, pierces them with its
bill and eats them. It soon grows tame in the
houses of the Spaniards, and is very useful in
gardens by killing noxious insects. I was often
moved to laughter by another river-fowL which,
when it stretches out its neck, exceeds a tall man
in height, and a lamb in the size of its body.
This bird is entirely white, and has very long
feet. It stands for many hours motionless, as if
meditating‚ in the water3 butI confess thatI
have forgotten its name.

WATER-CROWS.

In the river Parana, and elsewhere, numerous
water-erows are seen. Their young are de-
voured with avidity by the savages, though they
all detest the thought of eating birds, hens,
or chioken. It would take a long time to men-
tion all the various kinds of water-fowl which

swarm in the larger rivers and subsist wholly
on fish.
