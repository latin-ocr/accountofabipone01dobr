PARAGI‘AY. · 223

b-red in the navels of calveS. Every merchant's
ship transports thirty, and sometimes forty, ox-
hides into Europe. Who can reckon the num-
ber of hides daily employed in manufacturing
ropes, building hedges and houseS, and making
trunks, saddIes, and wrappers for the herb of
Paraguay, tobac00‚ sugar, wheat, cotton and
other things? The common people amongst the
Spaniards have no other bed than an ox-hide
stretched upon the ground, which is also the ,
case with an innumerable crowd of negro slaves.
fsseef is the principal‚ daily, and almost only
food of the lower orders in Paraguay. More-
over that quantity of meat which would over-
load the stomach of a European is scarce suf-
ficient to satisfy the appetite of an American. A
Guarany, after fasting but a very few hours,
will devour a young· calf. An Indiam before he
lies down to sleep, places a piece of meat to
roast at the fire, that he may eat immediately
when he wakes. Place food before him, and
the rising and the setting sun will behold him
with his jaws at work and his mouth full, but
with an appetite still unsatisfied. Such being
the voracity of the inhabitants, and so continual
the slaughters of innumerablc oxen, you will
agree with me that Paraguay may be called the
devouring grave, as well as the seminary of
cattle.
