PARAGUAY. 97

Paraguay, called Belen, is situated on the banks
of the Ypaneguazu, to the north of Asumpcion.
It was built in 1760 for Indians of the savagest
kind, called Guaycurus or MbayaS. They are
very expert horsemen, large and generally
tall, hostile in the highest degree to the

Spaniards, full of the absurdest superstition Ἰ

and arrogance, and, as appears from their cloth-
ing and manners, ignorant of the very name of
modesty. Their only care is that of their
horses and arms, in the management of which
their skill is admirable. War, or more cor—
rectly pillage, is the occupation they reckon
most honourable. In 1745, they laid waste
the lands of Paraguay, with exceeding perti-
nacity. The greater part of the province was
more employed in regretting the slaughters and
the rapine, than in preventing them, nor could
they devise any remedy for the evil. The sol—
diers were nowbaffled by their swiftness‚ now
unexpectedly surprized by their designs, and
now discomfited by their powerful assaults.
The savageS, elated by the daily victories they
had gained for many yearS‚ could neither be
restrained by the arms of the Spaniards nor
appeased by sair words. At last, in the six-
teenth year of the present century, the desired
peace was at length brought about, and a colony
founded in the place above-mentioned. To
