PARAGUAY. 333

SWALLOWS.

Before Î™ proceed from birds to fishes, I think
proper to subjoin a few remarks upon common
hens and swallows, the latter of which no ways
differ from those of Europe in appearance, voice,
and habits. Although Paraguay is free from
snow, yet as the south wind renders the air
rather cold in winter, the swallows migrate like
those of Europe to other places about the be-
ginning of autumn, and pass the winter in some
unknown retreatS, but return at the commence-
ment of spring.

BRAZILIAN FOWLS.

The Paraguayrian hens have the same form and
variety of colour as the* European. A few years
ago, hens much larger, but not better than the
common ones, were brought into Paraguay from
Brazil. Their flesh is hard and unsavoury.
The chickens are not clothed with feathers
within several weeks. The cock is unusually
large, and instead of the crest which those of our
country wear, displays a large purple crown.

Now let us proceed to the scaly tribes of Para-
guay.

I never found any European fish throughout
