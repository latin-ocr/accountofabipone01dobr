brious, especially to those who labour under a
difficulty osurine, or any disease of the bladder.
The second place to this river is occupied by
the Pilcomayo, which also flows from the Pe÷
ruvian mountains. The distance between it
and the Rio Grande is reckoned at thirty
leagues. It is not navigable at all times, nor
in all places. N early eighty leagues from its
junction with the Paraguay‚ it splits into two
arms, forming an island of as many leagues in
length. The first of these arms which flows
into the Paraguay, within sight of Asumpcion,
is called by the Guaranies Aragzcaaff, or the
wise river; possibly because the greatest saga-
city is requisite to effect its navigation. The
whole island is annually flooded, so that both
branches of the river coalescing into one channel,
it must be attributed to fortune, rather than to
skill, if any pilot pass over the opposing shal-
low& and the meanders of its waters in sasety.
