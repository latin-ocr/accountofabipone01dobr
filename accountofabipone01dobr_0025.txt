PARAGUAY. 7

be injured. This they threw in each other’s
teeth. Transient‚ however, was the advantage
which Paraguay derived from this victory; for
peace being ratified between the European
powers, the Spaniards restored Nova Colonia
to the Portugueze, that they might recover the
Havanna, and Manilla‚ capital of the Philip-
pineS‚ both which places the English had taken
from them. After a few years, war was re-
kindled3 and Pedro ZevaHOS, having conquered
the Island of Santa Catharina, took it a second
time. Finally, in the last peace concluded be-
tween the courts of Madrid and Lisbon, it was
ceded to the Spanish. This was a bitter loss to
the Portugueze, yet by the accession of new
territories, many more inlets were opened to
them. Cuyaba, a place rich in gold, Matto
Grosso, the little fort of S. Rosa, (called La
Estacada,> and other colonies, were added to
Portugal. Some think this intimate connec-
tion dangerous to Peru, hurtful to the Spa-
niards, and advantageous only to the Portu-
gueze, For what should hinder the latter, ac-
customed, as they are, from their infancy, to
arms and difficult routes, and never slothful in
extending the limits of their kingdom, from
going and possessing themselves of the treasures
of Potosi‚ a mountain abounding in silver, but

destitute of iron, and of men to wield it?
