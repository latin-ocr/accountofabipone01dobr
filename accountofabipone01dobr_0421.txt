THE URUCUY.

The urucuy“‚ which is half shrub half tree, re-
sembles a hazle in the whiteness of its wood,
and the blackness of its bark. Its leaves arc
rather large, and heart-shaped. The flowers,
which are composed of five white petals, tinged
with red, are about the size of a common rose,
but have no scent whatever. For fruit it bears
podS, which are green at first, and afterwards
red, each containing about forty grains the size
of peas, but plain on both sides, and. with a
white pulp‚ like the seeds of apples. The sur-
faee of them is of a deep bright red, and imme-
diately dies the hands of all who touch it with
that colour. The pods, when ripe, burst open
os themselves, These grainS, either dry or
fresh, supply the place of vermillion: when
pounded, and sprinkled with water, they are
used by the savages, sometimes sor painting
their bodies, sometimes for dying or staining
cloth, vessels, or other things. This scarlet co-
lour, when a thing is once tinctured with it, ad-
heres pertinaciously‚ if the grains of the urucuy‘,
steeped in water, be mixed with alum or urine.
The same grains are thrown into boiling water,
and of the colour that settles at the bottom
cakes are made, which the women in Europe
paint their faces with, and painters and dyers
