pulsion from a land he could not fail to love,—
a land pleasant in its situation, salubrious in its
climate, wide in extent, the envy of the Spanish
cities for its churches and other edifices,
adorned with woods, with rivers and with
plains of the greatest fertility, and lastly, well
stored with all the necessaries of subsistence?
J oachim de la Viana, governor of Monte-Video,
sent forward with a detachment of cavalry to
explore the country, having leaped from his
horse on the summit of an eminence‚ and exa-
mined through a telescope the city of S. Mi-
guel, (a place inhabited by seven thousand
Indiam, and famous for its magnificent churches
and famous row of buildings‚) in his astonish-
ment at the size of the place, exclaimed to the
horsemen about him,-—“ Surely our people at
Madrid are out of their senses, to deliver up to
Portugal this town, which is second to none in
Paraguay.” This he said, though a strenuous
favourer of the Portugueze, whose party he
embraced to ingratiate himself with Barbara,
Queen of Spain. The six other towns—those
of S. Juan, S. Lewis, S. Nicholas‚ S. Borgia,
and S. Lawrence, were also eminent for the
number of their inhabitants and the beauty of
their churches, though neither of them was

fortified with wall, ditch, palisadoeS, or even a
gate.
