366 AccouNT OF THE ABIPONES.

which, having exceedingly tall, straight, and
large trunks, afford excellent materials for ships,
and all sorts of building, as they never feel de-
cay, and last for ever, even under water. No
tree which Paraguay produces makes longer or
wider beams, which, as they are laboriously

hands with a saw, and conveyed in waggons from
Tucuman full three hundred leagueS‚ sell very

are to be seen, and whither they are brought from
the distant forests of Asumpcion, after a two
months’ navigation on the river. In Tucuman,

moved to the cedars by water underneath the
wheel, with a great saving of time and labour3
but it was soon after removed and destroyed by
the nativeS‚ who hate all innovation. Some-
times out of one cedar a very large boat is made,
to pull which thirty rowers are hardly sufficient.
I do not deny that the tree timboy⁹ is made into

their trunk, in the docility of the materials, and
their durability under water. There are two
