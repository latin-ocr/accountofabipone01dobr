PARAGUAY. 395

Some parts of Paraguay produce yellow cot-
ton, but this is very uncommon; for in every
other place throughout the country the cotton
is as white as snow, and grows on shrubs which
are reared from seed sown in little plots of
ground, and yield fruit many years, If any
plant witherS, or grows old, fresh seed is sown,
and another succeeds which bears fruit the first
year. Cotton loves a sunny elevated situation,
exposed to the winds on every side, and full of
stoneS. However favourable the soil may na—
turally be to the production of cotton, it
always requires exquisite culture. It must be
ploughed, and weeded over and over again, to
clear it of thistles, tareS, and grass. The fur-
rows and ditches, into each of which three or
four fresh cotton seeds are placed, must be dug
in a right line, and at such a distance from one
another that the oxen and ploughmen may have
room to pass through the intermediate spaceS.
The same field, indeed, must be fresh ploughed
every year, and, at the approach of spring, the
plants, which have been stripped of their leaves
in the winter, are cut like vineS, and quickly
covered with new foliage. The poorer sort
amongst the Spaniards of Paraguay wear cot-
ton shirts3 the richer, linen ones. They prefer
paying an inordinate price for linen webs
