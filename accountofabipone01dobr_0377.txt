PARAGUAY. 359

crackling‚ caused by the* oil flowing from the
top and from the boughs: sor the warm air,
insinuating itself more freely into the pores of
the wounded tree, seems to rarefy and liquidate
the oil, which is naturally resinous and thick.
To effect this sooner and with more certainty
apply dry burning boughs to the opposite side
of the tree into which the incision has been
made3 by their heat, the oil is more dispersed
amongst the fibres of the tree, and moreliquefied,
which causes it to flow freely into the vessel
placed beneath the trunk. Within a sew hours
you will find a jug full of oil. If you wish to
fill many jugs cut many of these treeS, which
are most abundant in the northern woods of
Paraguay3 there are none, or very few, else-
where. This operation must be performed in
spring, in the month of September, when the
moon is at full; if you undertake it in the ab·
sence of the moon, in winter, or summer, you will
lose your labour. This oil, in colour, could not be
distinguished from water3 it has a bitter taste,
exhales an odour neither sweet nor the con-
trary, and is useful both to painters and phy-
sicianS. I will now make you acquainted with
its virtueS, which I learnt from others, but
never tried myself. When warmed and ap-
plied to a wound, it is said to stop the flowing

of the blood, and to heal the wounded person
