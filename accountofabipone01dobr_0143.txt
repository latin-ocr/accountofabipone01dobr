small-pox. Nearly the same fate has swept
away the equestrian tribes of the Malbalaes,
MataraS‚ Palomos, Mogosnas, Orejones, Aqui-
lotes, ChurumateS, Ojotades‚ Tanos, QuamalcaS,
&c. The equestrian nations remainingin Chaco‚
and still formidable to the Spaniam& are the
Abipones, N atekebitS, Tobas, Amokebsts, Μο-
cobiOS, Yapitalakas, or Zapitalakas‚ and Oeka-
kakalotS, Guaycurus, or Lenguas. The Mbayas
dwellingon the eastern shore of the Paraguay call
themselves EyiguayegiS‚ those on the western
Quetiadegodis. The pedestrian tribes are the
Lules, the Ysistines Foxistines‚ who speak the
same language, to wit the Tonocote, and have
been, for the most part, converted by us, and
settled in towns: the Homoampas, VileIas,
ChunipieS, YookS‚ Ocoles, and PazaineS‚ who
are in great part Christians: the Mataguayos,
whom we have so often attempted to civilize,
but who always proved indocile ε the Payaguas,
the Guanas, and the Chiquitos. By the annual
excursions of men of our order to the woodS‚
savages speaking various languageS, as the Za-
mucos, CaypotadeS, Ygaronos, &o were added
to the colonies of the Chiquitos.

The ChiriguanOS‚ a nation very famous for
number, fierceness and obstinacy, can scarcely,
I think, be referred to Chaco, as the majority of
thern inhabit the territories of Tarija and Peru.
