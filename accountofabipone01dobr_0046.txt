28 AccouNT OF THE ABIPONES.

N eengiru whom the Europeans called King of
Paraguay, whilst Paraguay itself had not an
inkling of the matter, At the very time when
the feigned majesty of the King of Paraguay
employed every mouth and press in Europe, I
saw this Nicholas N eengiru, with naked feet, and
garments after the Indian fashion, sometimes
driving cattle before the shambles, sometimes
chopping wood in the market-place ; and when
I considered him and his occupation, could
hardly refrain from laughter.

But mark the progress of King Nicholas's
fate. To obtain for the base fiction an ap-
pearance of truth‚ a person in the kingdom
of Quito was bribed to get money coined and
stamped with the name of King Nicholas.‘
This base money was issued both in Europe
and America, and no one could doubt its
being coined in Paraguay by the pretended
king, where, from the want of bullion, the Ca-
tholic kings themselves had no mint. The
deceit however at length appeared 3 on March
the 20th, 1760, the artificer of the coin wrote
a letter to the King, in which he confessed—
“ that> he was compelled by the secret stings
of conscience to divulge his cri1ne,'’ Sec. This
letter detected the venal wretch who instigated
him to coin the money of King N icholas.
