356 AccoUNT or THE ABIPONES.

composed of one large expanded leaf, as soft as
silk. The bark, when stripped of the rough
outer skin, and properly ground, is of much effi-
cacy in healing wounds inflicted by the teeth
or claws of a tiger.

THE ZAMUu.

The zamuu is ridiculous both in name and
form; for the Spaniards call it palo borraclzo,
the drunken tree. It is lofty. It has a trunk
surrounded with largish thornS, and bears mid-
dle-sized flowers of a beautiful red colour‚ but
is of very singular appearance in other respect&
For the highest and lowest parts of the trunk
are small, while the middle swells out to a
great width, like a barrel: on which account
its very soft wood is easily made into tubs, and
barrels. The farther this tree grows from rivers
the wider it swells‚ so great is its dislike to
water. It bears a round fruit like certain large
gourds, with a very strong rind, which fruit,
when ripe, bursts open and discovers woolly
flakes, like cotton, and softer than silk, but

with so short a fibre that it is very difficult to ⁵

draw them out into a thread. The thorns of this

tree when bruised to powder‚ and boiled, tinge
the water with a red colour which is said to

cure sore eyes,
