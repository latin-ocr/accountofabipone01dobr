PARAGUAY. 95

Indian returns, giving the same account as be«
fore, and with confirmed suspicions respecting
the fearful delirium of our new Christian. Sus-
pecting there was something in it, I imme-
diately hastened to his house, and found him
sitting. , On my enquiring how he felt himself,
“ Well‚” he replied, smiling‚ “ and entirely free
from pain ;” but added, “ that he got no sleep at
night owing to the appearance of his mother and
sister, admonishing him to hasten his baptism,
and threatening to take him away unexpectedly.
He told me over and over again, with his usual
unreservedness, that this prevented him from
getting any rest. Ι thought it probable that
this was a mere dream, and worthy, on that
account, of neglect. Mindful, however, that
dreams have often been divine admonitions and
the oracles of God, as appears from Holy Writ,
it seemed advisable, in a matter of such mo-

- ment, to consult both the security and tran-

quillity of the catechumen. Being assured of
his constancy, and of his acquaintance with the
chief heads of religion by previous interroga-
tories, I soon after baptized him with the name

ι of Lewis. This Ι did on the 23d of June, the

eve of St. John, about the hour of ten in the
morning. On the evening of the same day,
without a symptom of disease or apoplexy, he
quietly expired.
