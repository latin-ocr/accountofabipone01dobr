geographers hear what the oft commended
Sanchez declares to be his opinion respecting
that imaginary lake Xarayes, and the fabulous
island De los Orejones,

“ The Paraguay,” says he, ‘⁶ collected into
one channel, for some time flows to the north,
but presently separates into three brancheS‚ one
of which the Indians call Paraguay-mii‘i, that is

guazii, or great Paraguay. These three branches
of the river are swelled by the usual floods, and,
overflowing their banks, inundate the plain
country for the space of two hundred leagues.
European strangers have mistaken this frequent
inundation, this collection of waters, which gene-
rally lasts for some time, for a permanent lake.
In the midst of this imaginary lake they placed
