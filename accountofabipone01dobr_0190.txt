172 ACCOUNT oF THE ABIPONES.

with it. It is certain that, about three miles
apart, you may perceive the waters to be differ-
ent both in colour and taste. The Parana,
which, a little before, flowed westerlyâ€š follow-
ing the Paraguay, changes its course, hastening
towards the sea, the mother of streamS. How-
ever you may despise this conjecture, it seems
to me to possess some probability. In the
country of St. Iago del Estero, the rivers Dulce
and Salado have frequently changed their chan-
nel on this very account, and the same has been
the case with regard to some other rivers. In
the city of St. Iago, St. Francisco Solano built
a dwelling-house, and 3 handsome church, for
his companions, in such 3 manner that the door
of it did not look toward the market-place of
the city, but towards the plain. The brothers
not approving of this plan, the architect Solano,
who was famous for the gift of prophecy, bade
them wait a little, saying, that what they now
desired, in ignorance of the future, would some
day really happen. Some years after, the river
Dulce, which washes the city, changed its chan-
nel. The city was forced to be changed also,
which being done, the door of the church fronted
the market-place, as it does at this day. The
event verified the predicfflon, which the native
Spaniards related to me when I was there. But
let us now return to the Parana.
