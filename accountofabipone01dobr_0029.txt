its distance is reputed to be an hundred leagues.

The other city, which the Spaniards call De
las Siete Corrientes, takes its name from seven
points of the rock jutting out into the Parana,
against which the current breaks with great
violence, and flowing on very rapidly, car-
ries down ships, coming up the stream, unless
in full sail under a strong wind. A row-boat,
in the passage of the river, must make many
windings to avoid the rapidity of the current,
as I have often experienced: for hard upon
the city, the great river Paraguay flows into
the still greater river Parana, the one changing
its course, and the other its name. For the
Parana, rolling on from east to west, when
joined to the Paraguay, hurries down in a
southerly direction with it. The Paraguay
loses its name for that of the Parana after its
junction with that river. It is inconceivable
with what a mass of water these conjoint
streams roll proudly down in one mighty chan-
nel. If you did not see the banks, you might
fancy it a sea. This place, in name alone a city,
and unworthy of the name, is chiefly composed
of mud-hovels, with roofs of palm-leaves. The
inhabitants are remarkable for their beauty‚
