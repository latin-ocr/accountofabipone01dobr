374 ΑοοουΝΤ OF THE ABIPONES.

and with the soft spungy materials¹ afforded by
their trunks, quickly build a little hut, and
cover it well with boughs and leaves of palms,
bent partly one way, partly another: should
the rain fall with the utmost violence, not a
drop will penetrate this hasty fabric. Of the
leaves of the pindo palms, cords, panniers,
and baskets are sometimes woven, as of osiers
in other places. These palms, not only by
their great height, but also by the length of
their boughs, which they gracefully extend,
afford a pleasing spectacle to the eye, and a
great ornament to gardenS.

THE ΥΑΤΑῨ.

The yata37‚ a smaller palm, besides dates,
yields a very tender germ, leafy at the top, as
soft as butter, and of a yellowish white, which

is eaten raw, as it is plucked from the tree‚ and ⁵

is very pleasant to the taste. Crowds of par-
rots daily fly to seed upon the nuts of this palm.

THE ΥΑΤΑῨ αυΑΖὺ.

The yatay guazii, which has very large bright ’

green leaves, and a rugged trunk‚ and is at
least five ells high, produces oval shaped nutS,
which the Spaniards call coccos. The pulp is
very small in quantity, but, if boiled, eatable.
In each nut there are three large kernels, as
agrecable to the taste as almondS, but more oily.
