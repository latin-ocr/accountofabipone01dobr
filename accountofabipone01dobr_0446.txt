428 ACCOUNT OF THE AfflPONEs,

reddish green colour. Its> slender boughs are
covered with four small leaves of a bright green
on one side, and awhitish hue on the other, and
are clothed with tender down. At the begin-
ning of the little boughs grow small yellow
flowers with red edges, han ging by a short stem,
and surrounded by three leaflets. The roots of
this plant are short, slender, and tortuous, and
on them hang yellow oblong pods with a soft
rind. Each of these pods contains either one or
two kernels, (for there are various species of the
mandubi,) beautifully covered with a red skin,
and inclosing a very white and very rich pulp.
These kernels, slightly fried or roasted‚ are much
liked even by Europeans. The oil expressed
from them is used instead ofoil of olives, to which
indeed it is superior, on lettuce ; and many eat
it with food in the place of butter or bees fat.
I have often wished that this excellent fruit grew
in Europe, where it certainly would be useful in
many ways.

of vegetables, there is an infinite variety of me-

England, Italy, Germauy, and Africa, into Pa-
raguay, which, dressed in various ways, serve
excellently both to fill the stomach and delight
