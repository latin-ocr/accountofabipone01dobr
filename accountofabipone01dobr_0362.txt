344 ACCOUNT oF THE ABIPONES.

to shore. The Indian who has remained be-
neath the water such a length of time that you
believe him inevitably drowned, you will, with
astonishment, behold emerging at a great dis-
tance, laden with booty. These men are more
properly divers, than fishers. If the transpa-
rency of the water, as in the river Salado, ren-
ders the fish visible, the Paraguayrians pierce
them with an arrow, a spear, or an iron prong.
The wood Indians catch fishes more usually by
craft and artifice than by arms. Sometimes
by throwing in sticks, and boughs of trees art-
fully entwined together, they darn up a river in
such a way that, though the fish can enter this
enclosure, they are unable to get out again.
In other places they throw the plant ycipotingi,
which creeps up trees, or the leaves or fresh
roots of the caraquata, well pounded, into the
water, which intoxicates the fishes to such a de-
gree that they may be caught with the hand as
they float on the surface. They often lash the
water with the leaves of a certain tree which
grows in great abundance near ‘the river Atingy“‚
the juice of which is said to be fatal to fishes.
The Indians sometimes catch fishes with hooks
made of wood or reeds, The common, and
indeed the only instrument sor fishing that I
used, was an iron hook baitecl with a piece of

fresh bees.
