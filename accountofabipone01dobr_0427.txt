PARAGUAY. 409

elsewhere to be like the Egyptian tree acacia,
of a well-known Paraguayrian herb, or of a
rich, black clay. Though cotton will take a
black dye, it will not hold it long3 consequently
the cotton dresses which we wore in Paraguay,
became almost of no colour, and the blackness,
by degreeS‚ faded away. The Spanishladies
of St. Iago, and the Chiquito Indians have
the art of dying cotton with a very lasting
black, a secret unknown to every one else.

A NAMELESS FRUIT AFFORDING,
A GREEN COLOUR.

Walking in a ‘wood on the banks of the
Narahage Ι discovered a shrub‚ before un-
known to me, covered with leaves of such a
very bright green that I felt an inclination
to taste them. Ι found them sweeter than
sugar, and thought to use them for sweetening
the herb of Paraguay. Applauding myself
vastly, for whatI thought so useful a discovery,
I gave a leaf to the Spaniard, my companion,
to taste; but he prudently declared, that he
should take care not to eat, or even touch that
strange plant. The Indian old women were
consulted on this affair: they told us that these
leaves were used for dying things green, but
were very poisonouS.
