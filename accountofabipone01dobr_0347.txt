IN DIAN CROWS.

Indian crows are black, like those of Europe,
but much longer3 their head and neck, as far as
the beginning of the wings, are bald, smooth,
quite destitute of seathem, but full of wrinkles.
These birds subsist on the carcasses and entrails
of slain beasts. Whenever oxen are killed in
the open plain, as usual there, they perch upon
trees or roofs of houses‚ presently rush down
upon the intestines, and one taking each end,
carry them through the air like a long rope.
Their king is clothed with extremely white fea-
thers, and though very seldom seen, flies ac-
companied by the other crOWS, as by satellites.
As birds of one feather flock together, the Abi-
pones, who live on rapine, bring up the young
of these rapacious crows at home, as they be-
come wonderfully tame: for they accompany
their masters when they ride out to hunt or enjoy
the country, partake their fare, and return when
they return, but sometimes suffer themselves to
be enticed away by flocks of crows which they
meet on the road. Crows' feathers are gene-

rally chosen for arrows by the savages, on ac-
count of their strength.
