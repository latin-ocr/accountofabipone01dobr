PARAGUAY. 35

Madrid by the royal letters, This principal
court minister had never admitted the exchange
of lands agreed upon with the Portugueze‚ but
had transmitted notices of it to Charles then
King of Sicily. For this, if we may credit a
report prevalent in Spain, the Marquis dela
Ensenada was banished. That was not the
happy time when you might think as you chose,
and speak what you thought.

King Charles not only refused to acquiesce
in the treaties ratified with the Portugueze, but
immediately declared war upon that people 3 to
the carrying on of which six thousand Guaranies
strenuously applied themselves in the royal
camp, under the conduct of Pedro Zevallos,
who having occupied Colonia, carried his vic-
torious arms into Brazil; but being stopped by
the news of peace having been restored in Eu-
rope, testified in his letters to the King, that the
success of his expeditioris was greatly owing to
the Guaranies. Suffer me, by way of episode,
to draw a rude sketch of the immortal hero
Zevallos. His father, the descendant of a noble
family in Spain, was royal governour in· the Ca-
narieS, and died in an insurrecfion, bravely
fighting for the crown. The son, Pedro ZevaIIOS‚
was handsome, tall, and well made, and the
comeliness of his person was set off by the ele-
gance and suavity of his manners Courteous
