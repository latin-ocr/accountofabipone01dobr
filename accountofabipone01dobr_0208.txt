exposed to all winds and storms. The south
wind, which rages most in those parts, threatens

cables be very strong and firm. Long, light
ships, called Lanchas, which are much used
in this river, draw to land by the river Ria-

reckoned to be,) affords a safer station for ves-
sels, and one nearer to land, being somewhat
defended against· the wind by high banks on one
side, and on the other by the neighbouring
island of St. Gabriel, though this very circum-
