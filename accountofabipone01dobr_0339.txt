PARAGUAY. '321

laughed very loud for a long time at an old In-
dian woman, whom we met riding on an ass.
Though he reposed all day long on my shoulder,
yet about sun-set, like fowlS, he felt a desire sor
rest, began to grow angry, and, by clapping his
wings, and repeatedlybiting my ear, admonished
me to stop the Journey. Next day when I
mounted my horse again, he was extremely de-
lighted, and did nothing but sing and laugh.
When I stayed in the town, he sometimes walked
up and down a very long rope suspended from
two pillars outside the house. When I entered
the dining-room he would fly after me, and
whilst we were dining, ran about the table,
and always flew angrily to bite the Indian who
came to take away the rest of the food with the
dishes. He tasted‚ snatched, and swallowed
any food that he¹ could lay hold of. He some-
times walked about the court-yard‚ rubbing
and sharpening his beak in the sand, which he
often swallowed by way of medicine. Seeing
me caress a smaller parrot of another species,
filled with envy he attempted to pierce the
>bird with his beak3 but softened by a little
coaxing, he not only suffered it to sleep under
his wings, but ever afterwards treated it as a
pupil, or rather as a son. What the older
bird pronounced with a deep voice, the younger
repeated in a slenderer one. Thc Guaranies
