The source of the river Parana has afforded
as much matter of controversy as the native city
of Homer. The Spaniards who first went to
subdue Paraguay, after travelling for the space
of full five hundred leagues, either on the stream
itself‚ or on its bankS‚ are said never to have
been able to arrive at its source. The Brazilian
Indians think the Parana originates in an im-
mense lake arising from the Peruvian mountains,
perhaps that called Lauricocha, near the Gua-
nuco, about the llth degree of latitude. Others,
with more appearance of probability, derive the
river Amazon from the lake above-mentioned,
though the Indians insist upon it that the Ama-
zon and the Parana both proceed from the same
source. But who would pay any attention to
what the Indians say? Many rivers flowing from
the Peruvian mountains vary their course every
now and then, and are mingled one with ano-
ther: now who, amid such a labyrinth of
streams, could so exactly distinguish the Para-
na from the rest as to leave no room for doubt?
It has been ascertained that this river, in its va-
rious turnings and windings, travels more than
eight hundred leagues before it disgorges itself
