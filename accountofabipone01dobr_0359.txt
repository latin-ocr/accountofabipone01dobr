not like those of the sea, but like those in
the rivers of Germany, were found in certain
streams in the territories of the Uruguay; and
I myself saw some which were brought to
our table in the Uruguayan town of Concep-
cion3 but they were pygmies in comparison
with ours, and might be called mere shadows,
and embryos of crabs. After travelling‚ sail-

The rivers, lakes, and strealnS, abound in
tortoiseS‚ but not of that kind the shells of
which are valuable in Europe, and fit for work-
ing. No sooner did we cast a hook into the
river than a tortoise would bite, but was always
rejected by us; for in the greater part of Para-
guay these animals are eaten neither by Spani-
ards nor Indians. The only useful part of tor-
toises in Paraguay is their great shells, which are
used for pots and plates by the common people.
