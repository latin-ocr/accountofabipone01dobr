PARAGUAY. 431

ASPARAGUS.

Asparagus grows wild in the plainS, but is
very bitter, and slenderer than a thread; if

cultivated in gardenS, it would become quite
glgantic.

ONIONS AND GARLICK,

Onions and garlick are diligently cultivated
with great care and expense by the Spaniards,

and are even eaten raw with avidityby hungry
persons.

FUNGUSES.

Various funguses are found both in the woods
and plains, but no one would venture either to
touch or taste them. Verengena, called by the
Latins melongena, tomateS‚ which the Germans
call apples of Paradise, and other condiments of
this kind, better known to Spaniards than Ger-
mans, are frequently seen in gardens and at
table. The Indians like sweet things, and de-
test radishes, mustard-seed, garden-nasturtium,
lettuces sprinkled with vinegar, in short, every
⁴ thing acrid, acid, or bitter. The Abipones,
who, leading a vagrant life, never take the pains
to sow, nor find occasion to reap, subsist, like
birds and beasts, on whatever their predatory
habits supply, or liberal nature gratuitously
