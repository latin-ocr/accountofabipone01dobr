THE TIGER.

Paraguay abounds in tigers from the number

They are all marked with black spotS, but the
skin of some is white, that of others yellow.

been killed the day before, fastened to the
ground with wooden pegs: it measured three

Tigers, whether springing out like cats or in
the act of flight, run extremely quick, but not

following facts will clearly prove. Should a
Spaniard‚ an Indian, and a Negro sleep toge-
