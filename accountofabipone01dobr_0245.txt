spirit, and that they are mere dwarfs and spec-
tres in comparison with those of Europe. Ι
boldly affirm that the Paraguayrian horses differ
nothing from those of our own country in size,
shape, and good qualities. You meet every-
where with horses of lofty, or of middling sta-
ture3 some well fitted for a vaulter, and others
for a man armed cap-a-pie. Pygmies, like Cor-
sican horseS‚ are as rare in Paraguay as comets
in the sky. I allow that Paraguay is as yet un-
acquainted with horses like the natives of the
Styrian mountainS, which almost resemble ele-
phants in their immense back, huge limbs, and
broad hoofs: this country produces slenderer
horses, better adapted sor riding and racing
than for chariots and waggons. But were they
fed like those of Europe on oats and barley,
and defended in a stable against the inclemen-

cies of the weather, they would very probably
grow to the same size. The horses of Para-
guay are born out of doors, and remain there, ε’
night and day, the whole year round3 are fed
upon any grass they can find, (which is not
always either very good, or very plentiful,) and
upon leaves of trees, or dry wood3 they often
seek in vain for water to quench their thirst,
and find it neither good, nor in sufficient quan-
tities. Being constantly in the open air, they

are exposed at one time to the scorching sun3
