VARIOUS KINDS OF DUCKS.

DuckS‚ clothed with black and white feathers,
are extremely numerous, and pass the day in the
water, and the night in trees close by it. They
are most easily and frequently shot out of the
water. Their young, when removed to townS,
seldom become tame. Other ducks, which the
Abipones call roakabl, have feathers of various
colours, and beautifully red feet. Small ducks,
called by the Abipones ruililie, flit about toge-
ther at night, making a loud hissing‚ and are be-
lieved by the Abipones to be spirits of the dead.
The most remarkable are certain middle-sized
ducks, of a beautiful rose colour from the head
to the tail, but their natural ill smell annoys the
nostrils of all who approach them, as much as
the beauty of their plumage delights beholderS.
Under the beautiful feathers of their wings and.
the rest of their body, (of which not only the
plume, but the quill, which we use to write
with, is tinged with a deep red colour,) is con-
cealed skin, bone, and a very scanty portion of
most stinking flesh. They are slcndcrcr than
geese’s quills, and arc used by thc Abipones to
adorn and crowu their hcads.
