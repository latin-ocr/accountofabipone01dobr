276 ACCOUNT oF THE ABIPONES.

ridiculous biscacha, which closely resembles a
hare, has a tail like that of a sox, and is marked
with black and white spots. Its hair is ex-
ceedingly soft. In the plainS‚ particularly in
the more elevated situations, these animals dig
themselves burrows so artfully‚ that no part of
them is exposed to the rain. They are di-
vided into separate apartmentS, as several fa-
milies usually inhabit the same place. On the
surface of the earth many doors are opened into
the cave, at Which crowds of them sit at sun-
set, and carefully listen if any one be approach-
ing3 but if all is quiet they go out to pasture
on moonlight nights, and make deplorable
havoc in the neighbouring plains; for they are
extremely fond of wheat and maize, and if
either of these is to be had, will not feed on
grass. At the doors of their burrows they heap
up dry bones, bits of wood, and any other rub-
bish they can light upon, but for what purpose,
no one hitherto has been able even to conjec-
ture. The Spanish rustics sometimes amuse
themselves with hunting these animaIS. They
pour many pitchers of water into their subter-
ranean dwellingS, so that, to avoid drowning,

the creatures leap out into the plain, and, no '

opportunity of escape being allowed them, are
killed with stakeS. Their flesh‚ unless they be
very old, is not despised‚ even by the Spa-
niardS.
