As the river La Plata has but a few ports,
and those not very safe ones, it consequently
threatens navigators with an hundred dangers,
on account of the sand-banks, and shoals which
occur here and there. The most remarkable of
these are two named El Banco Ingles, and El
Banco Ortiz; both of which are many leagues

dos Lobos, and La Isla de Flores, and still more
by huge crags in the neighbourhood of the port
of Monte-Vide0‚ called Las Carretas de Monte-

the pilot is not thoroughly acquainted with
the river, or if he neglects to make frequent
use of the sounding-line, a shipwreck is inevi-

high heaps of sand, or will spring a leak from
being dashed against the rocks. This may the
