PARAGUAY. 357

ΤΗΕ ΜΑΝαΑῨ.

The mangay‘ is about the size of a cherry-
tree, and bears white flowers, which exhale a
very delightful odour. It produces fruit of a
golden colour, and equal in size to a large plum,
which, when ripe, are agreeable to the teste,
but hurtful to the stomach. Both the tree
and. the fruit overfiow with a kind of milky, and
resinous juice, called mangaffci, in the Guarany
tongue, which streams out plentifully, when
you cut the bark, and is caught by the hand,
or by a board. The air curdles it, and gives it
the appearance of a little skin. In this state,
it is rolled up into balls, which are so remark-
ably elastic, that when thrown lightly upon the
ground they leap up very high in the air.
This liquor, mangaffch is said to be very usesul
in cases of dysentery. It is much to be la-
mented that so very few take the trouble to
collect this rosin, which would be useful in
Europe in various ways.

DRAGON'S-BLOOD.

The tree caiz veru, which produces the dra-
gon's-blood, is middle-sized both as to height
and bulk. Some botanists call these trees

palma? premiserce soliis jacere, but 111 my opinion -

they have no affinity whatever with pallus.
