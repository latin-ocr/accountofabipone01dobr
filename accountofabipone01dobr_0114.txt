96 ACCOUNT OF THE ABIPONES.

This. event, a fact well known to the whole
town, and which I am ready to attest on oath,
astonished every one. I leave my reader to
form his own opini0n3 but in my mind I could

Ι attribute it that these three Indians were dis-
covered by me in the unknown recesses of the
woods3 that they so promptly complied with
my exhortations to enter my town, and em-

palado, though attended with so many hard-
ships and dangers, is still most grateful to my
heart, inasmuch as it proved highly fortunate
to the three wood Indians and advantageous to
the Spaniards. These last, having been certified
by me, that, upon the immense tracts of wood—
land here mentioned, not a vestige of the sa-
vages remained, collected, during the three
years they stayed, many hundred thousand
pounds of the herb of Paraguay, from which
they derived an amazing profit. Thus much on
the Guarany towns of Taruma. If on this sub-
