394 ACCOUNT OF THE ABIPONES.

separates into three partS, thrusting out white
cotton, full of black seedS‚ resembling pistachio
nuts in size and shape. Under the black skin
of these seeds is concealed a yellowish white
pith, of a sweet taste‚ very oily, and of much
use in allaying cough and difficulty of respira-
tion. The oil expressed from themis said to
be efficacious in cases of stone and in cutaneous
disorders. Cotton itself‚ when burnt, will stop
the flowing of blood. As the cotton gradually
ripens and bursts from its prison, it is not ga-
thered all at once, but collected day by day.
In the Guarany towns this is the business of
the girls, who walk about the field, and pluck
the fruit with a gentle hand, that the shrubs
may not be injured. The cotton daily collected
is spread on hides in the court-yard of the
house, and laid out in the sun to dry. If this
be properly attended to, it may either be safely
kept for years in a leathern bag, or spun into
thread as soon as you like. To extract those
seeds from the cotton the women make use of
a wooden machine, consisting of a couple of cy-
linders, the thickness of two fingers, into which
they insert the cotton, and, twisting it about with
their handS, cause the seeds to fall out of them-
selves3 because, as they are thicker than the
space between the cylinders, they are squeezed

out by them.
