pour it, mixed with cold water, on a hide,
which serves both for tub and drinking vessel,
where, without addition of any thing else,
in about twelve houm, it effervesces so much
with its own natural heat‚ as to become at

head and feet, and still more the tongue3 yet,
when taken in moderatim, it is a means of
strengthening the constitution, and inducing
uncommon longevity. Moreover horses, muleS‚
and oxen are never fatter, or more robust than
