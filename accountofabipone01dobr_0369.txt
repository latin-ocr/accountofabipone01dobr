PARAGUAY. 351

This plant is called by the Spaniards zarza
parrilla, on account of its thorns, sor zaraa in
Spanish means a thorny plant; parrilla, in the
same langnage, signifies a gridiron3 as there-
fore the leaves of this plant bear some sort of
resemblance to a gridiron, three pretty large
veins running lengthways, crossed by a number
of smaller ones, it has received the name parrilla
or gridiron3 but botanists call it ,ςηιὶἰαηἲ aspera
Peruviana, ‘or sarmentum Indicum. The zarza
parrilla is very common on the banks of the
Uruguay, and the Rio N egro, the waters of
which are celebrated for their salubrity3 itis
also found near the Rio Tercero, in the territo-
ries of Sta. Fe, and other parts of America.
The most famous is that which comes from the
bay of Honduras. The roots of the zarza parrilla,
which possess a medicinal virtue, are scarce
thicker than a goose's quill, wrinkled on the
surface, and of a dusky colour, but white
within3 all of them grow from the same joint
or knot of the plant. They have no particular
taste or smell. They consist of rosin, and gum
which is the softer part of them. The various
uses of these roots are too well known to phy-
sicians to need an explanation from me.
