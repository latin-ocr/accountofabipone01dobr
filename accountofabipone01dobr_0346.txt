328 ACCOUNT OF THE ABIPONES.

tender. As parrots are exceedingly suspicions,
all times are not equally proper for hunting
them. When they assemble on the highest
boughs, one of them occupies the top of the
tree, that, if any body approaches, he may warn
his companions of their danger, and exhort
them to ssight by sudden clamour. About sun-⁵
set they compose themselves to rest like hens.
A great crowd generally assemble on one trec,
and as each strives to get the highest bough,
continual quarrels ensue——one trying to push the
other from the seat that he has obtained, whilst‚
amid horrid clamourS, the feathers that they have
torn from each other with their beak or claws‚
fly about in all directions. During these con-
tentions for the highest place, the hunter steals
softly thither, and with a gun, or a bow, knocks
down the disputing bipeds. If ever you hear
the parrots, which you see in the houses of the
wealthy, called by other names than those I
have mentioned, remember that they must have
been brought from other countries, of Asia,
Africa, or America. White parrotS, with a
little red erest, called cockatOOS, and others of
a grey colour, which I have often seen in Ger-
many, are unknown to Paraguay. The smaller
parrots, which we call tuy in the Guarany
tongue, have the French name perroquet given
them in Europe.
