PARAGUAY. 175

size, and will bear tolerably large vessels, Four

leagues from the bank of the Parana you meet
' with a cataract thirty eus high, from which the
river falls headlong, with a frightful noise, and
such a foam proceeds from it that the thick
vapour, covering the place like a cloud, may be
seen at four leagues distance. As this cataract
is utterly impassable‚ navigators travel by land,
for some time, and drag their boats along with
their hands, Three leagues from the cataract
the river is only one league in width. The
Ybirayty⁰‚ the Yabebiry“‚ which flows past the
Guarany towns of St. Ignatius-miri‚ and N ues-
tra Senhora de Lorett0, is narrow but very deep,
the St. Ambrose, the Rio de los Astores and the
Rio de Sta. Lucia. Through these last—men-
tioned rivers we have often known those cruel
pirates the Payaguas come to plunder the es-
tates of the Spaniards, and slay the inhabitants.
The CorrienteS, a moderate-sized river, which
rises from the neighbouring lake Ybera, for-
merly called Lago de los CaracaraS, said to be
about four miles in length, but of inconsiderable
and varying breadth. Many islands which it
contains, are chosen at this time by Indian run-
aways, as places of concealment3 and we learn
that, in the last century, they were inhabited
by the Caracara Indians who proved very for—
midable, and almost invincible‚ to the Spaniards.
