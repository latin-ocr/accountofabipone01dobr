PARAGUAY. 69

at the door of the house, there arose a mighty
trepidation amongst the women and children.
“ There is nothing at all to be afraid of, dear
sisters,'' said the eldest of my IndianS. “ You
see before you your relations, the descendants
of your ancestors. Not one of us harbours an
evil thought towards you. I am the chief and
director of them all.” “ What the old man has
told you,” said Ι, “ is perfeetly true. No one
present is evilly disposed towards you but my-
self. I am a terrible fellow; for'' (putting on a
fierce countenance and uttering a hiss) “ at
one mouthful Ι intend to devour two or three
children.'’ This pleasantry changed all their
terror into laughter. The women returned to
their stations, and with one accord entreated
me to enter the house. “ You will never per-
suade me to that‚'’ replied Ι. “ I see you have
dogs and whelps amongst you, and where dogs
are there must fleas be also: now there is no-
thing I dread so much as fleaS, beeause they
are disturbers of sleep, which, after the fatigues
of a long journey, Ι feel myself sorely in want
of. But I will not go far from your residence.
In this open spot, where I may see and be seen
by all, Ι am resolved to station myself.” And
truly, for the sake both of decorum and secu-
rity, I spent three days and nights in the open

air, though the weather was occasionally rainy.
