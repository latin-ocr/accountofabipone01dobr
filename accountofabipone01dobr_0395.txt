PARAGUAY. 377

food3 a sweet drink‚ and even a kind of bread,
being made of it, which is much liked by the
Indiam, but to my taste extremely insipid.
The jujub is used by European physicians for
allaying pains in the breast, cough‚ hoarseness
and pleurisy: whether the Paraguayrian mistol
possess the same virtues or no, I cannot tell.

THE CHANAR.

The tree chafiar has a yellowish and very
hard wood: the fruit supplies both meat and
drink‚ and is dried and preserved by some.

THE YACANE.

The fruit of the yacane tree is of a yellow
colour, about as large as a middle-sized citron‚
and in taste like a rotten pear.

THE QUABYRA GUAZU, ΛΝΒ
THE QUABIYU.

The quabyra guazii, which somewhat resem-
bles a plum, and the quabiyu, which is more
like a cherry, are used both as meat and drink.
The quabyra is very abundant, and much liked
by the Indians3 but was always nauseous to
my taste, for it smells like a bug. Both the
trees which produce these fruits afford very
good wood for turning.
