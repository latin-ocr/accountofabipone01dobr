308 AccoUNT oF THE ABIPONES.

race of frogS, Ι had long wished that the vora-
cious Indians would take it into their heads to
eat them, for whenever we slept in the open air
by the side of a river or lake, we were ex-
ceedingly annoyed by their croaking. Their
voice, as well as colour, is extremely various,
for some utter a gentle, clear, sharp sound,
others, perhaps the more aged oneS, a rough,
hoarse, disagreeable croaking. Of toads, horse—
leeches, and other insects of that description,
we shall speak in another place.

BIRDS.

Paraguay has scarcely any European bird,
except the swallow, but it abounds in native
ones, foreign to Europe. The former excel in
the sweetness of their voice, the latter in the
elegance of their plumage. Out of many Ι will
describe a few.

THE HUMMlNG- BIRD.

The most curious is a bird, which is the
smallest, and at the same time the most beauti-
ful of all the winged tribe. The Spaniards have
with justice named it picaflor, for it plucks the
fiowers out of which it sucks juice like a bee. It
charnis the eye with the exquisite beauty of its
colour and plumage. The whole of its little
body is scarce bigger than un olive or a nutmeg.
