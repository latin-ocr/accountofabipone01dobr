in his own words. “ Not far from the town of
St. Iago is a hot spring, surrounded on all sides
by woods. It is wide, about three feet deep,
and emits a sound like that of a boiling kettle,
occasioned by the water bubbling up from the
bottom. On dipping your foot into it you feel
a violent heat, which in a short time becomes
tolerable. Little fishes swim in these waters,
without however doing-them any injury; b'ut
their sulphureous odour renders them very dis-
agreeable. The banks of the fountain are sur-
'rounded by lime-stones. The sarther the ⁴water
recedes from the spring, the colder it becomes¹
forming a river, which, about three leagues
beyond the town of Santissimo Corazon de
Jesu, loses itself aniid extensive palm groves.
Many persons who had been long, and grievous- ’
ly ill, derived much benefit from these springs,
In sight of the town of St. J uan, at the borders
of the rocks, rises another small fountain, bub-
bling with the heat of its waters3 it forms a
lake in the neighbouring vale, which gives birth
to another river. That water is hot at its
source, but gradually cools as it goes along,
and is drunk by the Chiqnitos: but it is of
an unpleasant taste, and not very wholesome.
Indeed the inferior fruitfulness of the women of
that town is ascribed by many to this water.
The same complaint is made by the inhabitants
