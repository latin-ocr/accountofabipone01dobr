PARAGUAY. 275

amoor white. That night I wished I could
have been separated from my body, so entirely
had that liquid exhalation penetrated my very
fibres, especially my cheek‚ which it burnt like
fire. My clothes, all of which I had entirely
thrown off, though daily exposed to wind, rain,
sun, and dust, sor more than a month, on the top
of the waggon, always retained the vile scent,
and could be made no possible use of. Had I a
hundred tongues I should think them all insuffi-
cient to convey an adequate idea of the stench
of this ill-scented beast. Whether it be urine
which it dis'chargeS, or any other liquid, I am at
a loss to determine. This is indubitable,——that if
TheophrastuS‚ Paracelsus, and any other che-
mist, had conspired together, in all their fur-
naces and shops, and with all their arts, they
could never have composed a stink more into-
lerable than that which the skunk exhales by
nature. Spirit of hartshorn‚ or any more pow-v
erful odour, is there be such, will be called
aromatic scentS, frankincense, balm of Gilead,
and the most fragrant carnations and roses, by
him that has once smelt the skunk. Europe
may be congratulated upon her good fortune in
being unacquainted with this cursed beast.
