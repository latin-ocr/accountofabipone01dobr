tations knew no end, when by the royal sum·
mons we were recalled to Europe, amid the
tears of all the Indian colonies. The captive
Gato also remained with us in the city fully
contented with his situation, and behaving so
well that his conduct obtained him baptism and
Christian wedlock. But not many months after
he died of a slow disease.

Our Indiam, returning from the woods of
Mbaevera, brought news that the quinsy was
,, raging among the savages3 that the jugglers,
especially Tupanchichu, endeavoured ’(οΌ per—
suade the ignorant multitude that this pest was
introduced by us, in order to inspire them with
a hatred of the ChristianS. I immediately de-
spatched letters to my provincial, in which I in-
formed him of my journey, the savages I had
discovered, and the intended foundation of a
settlement. He approved my design, and when
my return to the savages drew near, supplied
my room in the town of St. J oachim with ano-
ther father. The royal governour, also, D. J o-
seph Martinez Fontes, was made acquainted
with what had been done and what was further
intended, and requested to invest me with the
power of founding the colony. But, alas! the
devil interrupted this prosperous course of af-
fairs, by means of two of his agents, the inhu-
man Tupanchichu and an opulent Spaniard.
