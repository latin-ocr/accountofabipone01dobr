PARAGUAY. 183

Mbaery‚ the Ypane-guazu, formerly the Gua-
rambare, the Yeyuy, navigable to large boatS‚
inipeded by many rockS, and⁴ augmented by
many rivers, the most important of which is the
Caapivary, which mingles its waters with the
Yeyuy‘, about twenty leagues before that river
enters the Paraguay. The shores of the Yeyuff,
and of the Caapivary, are surrounded by im-
mense woodS, nurseries of the herb of Para-
guay, a vast quantity of which is carried from
the town Curuguati to the city of Asumpcion‚
by the other Spanish inhabitants But let us
proceed. The Paraguay receives into itself
the following streams: the Tobaty‚ the Caa-
nabe, and the Tebiguary, navigable to middle-
sized vessels. By the accession of so many,
and such considerable tributary streamS, the
Paraguay is increased to such a size, that the
old Spaniards used to sail through it to the
city of Asumpcion‚ and even niore distant
placeS‚ in the same ships which had borne
them on the Ocean, from the port of Cadiz.
At this time no one dares attempt that, for sear
of being wrecked, for this river swells to such
a breadth‚ that you often cannot see either
bank, as on the sea. It is intersected by many
islands, and abounds in rockS, shallows, and
quicksands. It is dangerous to sail on it with-

out a pilot, called Pratico‚ well acquainted
