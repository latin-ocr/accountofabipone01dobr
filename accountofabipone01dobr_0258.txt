drawing carts, and are consequently more
healthy and spirited than European horseS,
which, during the greatest part of their liveS,
are chained, like thieveS, in dark stableS, which
resemble dungeons, are obliged to fill rather

a stone and straw harder than a board, taste
oats seldomer and more sparingly than country
people do cakeS, and endure frequent and long
hunger and thirst, sometimes through the dis-
honesty or laziness of servantS‚ sometimes
through the avarice of their masters, who are
more anxious about employing than about feed-
ing their beasts3 not to mention the continual
annoyance they undergo from the putting on
and taking off of their iron shoes3 and even the
pain frequently inflicted on them in this opera—
