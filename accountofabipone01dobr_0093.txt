Cacique Roy had a little house for himself and
family separate from the rest3 yet during the
three days we spent with them, he passed the
night in that vast dweIling I have named, whe-
ther anxious for the safety of his own subjects
or of us, I know not. We spent our nights in
the open air in the middle of the dwellings of
the savageS. I cautioned my men to sleep and
watch by turns, lest we should be surprised in
our sleep by the designs of many. But there
was not a symptom or occasion of sear on either
side, ·though the suspicion of danger never left

men of . my associates, with Arapotiyu, to
slaughter an ox, which I had left at a distance,
and bring its fiesh to make a feast sor the
savages. Nothing could have been devised
better calculated to raise their spirits; sor the
Americans never rejoice with more heartfelt
glee, nor pay a more prompt obedience, than
when their stomachs are full of bees. The Ca-
cique had a pleasure in spending many hours of
the day in familiar conversation with me. Hc
