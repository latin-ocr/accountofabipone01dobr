184 ACCOUNT or THE ABIPONES.

with the river, who must be hired to go before
the ship in a boat, and sound the depth every
now and then. At night you must rest in a
safe situation, and anxiously seek port on an
approaching storm. But alas! spite of every
art that can be exerted, vessels often stick in
shoals, and quicksandS, out of which they must
be taken on the shoulders of the sailors, or,
with the assistance of a skiff, in great part un-
]oaded. For many persons, through greediness
of gain, load their vessels with so much mer-
chandise, that you can scarce see two palms
of wood above the water, in consequence of
which, if the wind blows violently‚ they are
swallowed up in the waves. This river is like-
wise rendered dangerous by two whirlpools—
places where, even when there is no wind, the
water twists into circles, and forms, in the cen-
tre, a whirlpool, which sucks up whatever
coines near it3 but it may be passed without
danger, unless the sailors are extremely stupid.
There is more danger in various other placeS‚
where the river hurries along like lightning,
and dashes vessels upon rocks or shallows. In
sailing against the stream, oars alone will not
suffice; sails must be mado use of likewise.
From these things you may judge that the na-
vigation of this river can never be'effected with—
out danger, and reasonable alarm.
