350 AccoUNT OF THE ABIPONES.

with a balsamic odour of a dusky colour, and a
very sweet scent, but extremely bitter. With
this balsam the Indians allay pains in the eyes,
head and stomach, if they arise from cold. The
bark is naturally white, but when torn from
the tree gradually assumes a dark yellow on
the surface, a little varied with pale spots: but
within, it is of a red colour, not like blood, but
like cinnamon, being tinged with a yellowish
cast. The taste is bitter, but the smell aromatic
and pleasant, though somewhat rancid. Some
call the Peruvian bark J esuits' powder, because
the Jesuit missionaries in Peru were the first
who made known its singular efficacy in expel-
ling severs. The celebrated physician Woytz
tells us that this medicine was first brought to
Europe, in the year 1650, by Cardinal de Lugo,
a Spanish Jesuit.

ZARZA PARRILLA.

Zarza parrilla is the root of a green, creeping
plant, armed at intervals with very small thorns.
It has leaves almost a span long, from the be-
ginning of which proceed two tendrils, with
which it entwines itself with other plants. The
flowers grow in clustersâ€š and give place to
berrics, which are first green, then red, and
when quite ripe, black, and wrinkled like dry
cherrieS, which they resemble in size and form.
