horns or claws of beasts, by a bullet, a spear,
or an arrow; on these occasions they take to
swimming, but the Indians generally swim aster
them, and bring them back to shore. During a
pretty violent south wind crocodiles are ren-
dered torpid by the cold at night, from being
immersed in pools3 but when the sun is risen,
they lie, like logs of wood, on the sunny shore to
warm themselves, and their limbs beingstiffened‚
and their senses almost gone, are pierced with
spears by the Abipones‚ without danger or trou-
ble. Leaving their bodies, they carry away no-
thing but the teeth, and the little bones of the
spine, which, being as hard as iron, as sharp as
awls, and at the same time elastic‚ are used by
them for the purpose of pricking their limbs, at
drinking parties. Crocodiles' teeth, which are
thought by the Indians extremely efficacious in
curing or preventing the bites of serpents, they
wear themselves, or sell to the Spaniards. The
flesh of crocodiles is tender, and so white that
it can hardly be distinguished from that of
sturgeon. Many American nations, especially
those which inhabit the islands of the OrinOCO,
and others, are said to feed on it. But in
Paraguay, excepting the Payaguas, who live
near rivers, scarce any other nation eats them,
because that country abounds in cattle, and
wild anim-als, as well as in vegetables and fruits.
